# Railway Configuration for ALKIMI Data Refresh Cron Service
# This service runs hourly to fetch and cache CEX/DEX trade data
#
# IMPORTANT: When deploying as a cron service in Railway:
# 1. Create a new service and select "Cron" as the service type
# 2. The cron schedule is configured via Railway UI, not this file
# 3. Recommended schedule: "0 * * * *" (every hour at :00)
# 4. Both this service and the bot service should mount the same volume at /app/data

[build]
builder = "dockerfile"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python main.py --mode refresh"
restartPolicyType = "NEVER"

# Note: Railway cron services don't need health checks or internal ports
# The service will run, execute the command, and exit
